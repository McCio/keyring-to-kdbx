# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Note: Dependabot uses "pip" ecosystem to read PEP 621 pyproject.toml files.
# This is compatible with uv - dependencies are read from pyproject.toml and
# updates maintain compatibility with the project's uv-based workflow.
